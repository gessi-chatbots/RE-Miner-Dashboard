US coverage is also limited to the East and West Coast. If you're in the midwest, you have no hope unless you're in a city of more than 500k people. Maybe in other countries it works better.

After being asked to edit this I can elaborate: viewing timelines on the trip planner often has less accurate information compared to maps. This may be because of inconsistency from the recent driver strike, which might not be the apps fault",

                "reply": "Hi! Do you know if the inaccurate countdown you saw was in real-time? You can tell by looking for little waves next to the arrival times. The real-time means that the prediction accounts for delays and disruptions. Without real-time, the app is showing the bus's scheduled time.

One thing I wish was different is the screen pinching feature to zoom in between the route map and the route times below the map. I frequently zoom in or out on the map but often catch the route times instead which drags them on my screen instead of scaling the map (the buffer between the two needs to be tighten up).",

You can measure before setting up your phone, then go through the setup guides and benchmark again to see how much has your phone been slacking in the background.\r\n\r\nYou can share your report through the app to the maintainers of the dontkillmyapp.com website who compile it and base the overall negative score on it.\r\n\r\nHow does the benchmark work? (Technical!)\r\n\r\nThe app starts a foreground service with a wake lock and schedules repetitive task on the main thread, a custom thread executor and schedules regular alarms (AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle). Then it calculates executed vs. expected. That's it!  \r\n\r\nFor more details check the code. The app is open source available at https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dontkillmy-app\r\n\r\nThis app is open source and this project is maintained by volunteers who care about the Android ecosystem, feel the current pain and want to make it better.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Doki (github.com/doubledotlabs/doki).",
