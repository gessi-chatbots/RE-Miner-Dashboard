<h1>RE-Miner</h1>
<p>The main goal of RE-Miner is to provide a user-friendly, easily accessible and reusable software tool for both researchers and mobile app developers. It is designed to facilitate replication studies and comparative analyses in the field of review-based natural language processing tasks, with a particular emphasis on feature extraction and emotion classification.</p>
<p>The tool is composed of two software-based contributions:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>RE-Miner-Hub</b>, a web-based service supporting the integration and comparison of feature extraction and emotion classification tasks, using various NLP models and providers. The source code of this software component is available at <a href="https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Hub">https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Hub</a>.</li>
<li><b>RE-Miner-Dashboard</b>, a cloud-based application to support user management, app and review persistence, automatic processing and analytical visualization of a batch of user reviews combining features and emotions emerged from these reviews. The source code of this software component is available at <a href="https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Dashboard">https://github.com/gessi-chatbots/RE-Miner-Dashboard</a>.</li> 
</ol>
<p>RE-Miner has been developed by the <a href="https://gessi.upc.edu/en">GESSI research group</a> of the <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en">Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)</a>. The GESSI research group conducts research in many fields of software engineering, with particular emphasis on requirements engineering, software quality, software architecture, service-oriented computing, open source software, software modeling and empirical research.</p>
